# Todo

- [x] add a disconnect reason [graceful, aborted, error, unspecified] to all disconnect handlers
- [ ] use a flag system (Interlocked/atomic to set states of the socket like sending or disconnected that you cant send anymore instead of null check of socket)

## Features

### Security

- [ ] start a connection with 'ssl' or 'end to end' encryption instead of 'unsecure'
- [ ] upgrade a existing 'unsecure' connection to use 'ssl' or 'end to end' for communication
- [ ] switch between 'unsecure', 'ssl' and 'end to end'
